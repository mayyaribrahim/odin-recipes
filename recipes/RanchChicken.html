    <h3>This Ranch Chicken recipe is an easy skillet meal with creamy sauce and zesty Ranch seasoning. Serve with a side of vegetables and spoon that delicious sauce over some warm baked potatoes!</h3>
    <p> This meal is definitely one of my favorite easy meals. It actually came about because I was trying to put a different spin on my super popular creamy chicken stew recipe. And this skillet meal is the perfect way to do just that.
 The chicken is perfectly seasoned and so flavorful, (with a little brush of melted butter for an extra crispy golden sear, I might add). And the sauce takes just minutes to make from there. </p>
 <h3>ingredients</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped yellow onion</li>

    <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>

 </ul>
 <h3>how to make it</h3>
